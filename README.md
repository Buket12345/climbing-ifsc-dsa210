I am Buket Çakır and this is my term project for DSA210.

# Hyphothesis: More events per season and higher average round score predict a Top-20 finish in a World Cup event.

# Motivation
Climbing is a sport that combines physical strength, technique, problem-solving, and mental focus. In competition climbing particularly in IFSC World Cup events, athletes face routes designed to test their endurance, precision, and adaptability under time pressure. The sport is divided into disciplines such as bouldering, lead, and speed, each requiring distinct skill sets and strategies. As an active climber at my university, I’ve experienced firsthand how consistent training and exposure to different routes can gradually improve performance. Still, I’ve often wondered whether this effect is also visible among professional athletes. Does competing more often actually help climbers perform better in later events? This project explores that question by analyzing official IFSC competition data to test whether participation frequency and prior performance scores can predict an athlete’s chance of finishing in the Top 20.
