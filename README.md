I am Buket Çakır and this is my term project for DSA210.

# Hyphothesis: More events per season and higher average round score predict a Top-20 finish in a climbing World Cup event.

# Motivation
Climbing is a sport that combines physical strength, technique, problem-solving, and mental focus. In competition climbing particularly in IFSC World Cup events, athletes face routes designed to test their endurance, precision, and adaptability under time pressure. The sport is divided into disciplines such as bouldering, lead, and speed, each requiring distinct skill sets and strategies. As an active climber at my university, I’ve experienced firsthand how consistent training and exposure to different routes can gradually improve performance. Still, I’ve often wondered whether this effect is also visible among professional athletes. Does competing more often actually help climbers perform better in later events? This project explores that question by analyzing official IFSC competition data to test whether participation frequency and prior performance scores can predict an athlete’s chance of finishing in the Top 20.

# Data Collection
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, titled “IFSC Competition Climbing Results (1991–2024)” 

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mxmlnv/ifsc-competition-climbing

This dataset contains publicly available results and athlete information scraped from the official IFSC website. It includes data on competition results, athlete profiles, and event details across multiple climbing disciplines (bouldering, lead, speed, and combined) from 1991 to 2024. Each entry in the dataset includes event-level information such as competition name, year, location, discipline, and round, along with athlete-specific data—including athlete name, nationality, rank, score, and time.
